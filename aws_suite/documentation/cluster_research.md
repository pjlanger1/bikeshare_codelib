# Cluster Research Summer 2024

## Introduction

This document presents the findings of our clustering analysis towards developing LSTM 1.0. 
The goal of this analysis is to identify meaningful clustering of stations within the system on the basis of geography and traffic patterns.

## Objectives

- To understand the distribution of data points.
- To identify distinct groups or clusters within the data.
- To analyze the characteristics that differentiate these groups.

## Methodology

### Data Collection

Data was collected from [source or database](#), which includes various metrics relevant to our study.

### Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing steps included:
- Normalization of data to ensure uniform scale.
- Handling missing values through imputation.
- Outlier detection and removal for cleaner and more accurate analysis.

### Clustering Algorithm

We employed the K-means clustering algorithm for this analysis:
1. **Initialization**: Set the number of clusters K and randomly initialize the cluster centroids.
2. **Assignment**: Assign each data point to the nearest cluster centroid.
3. **Update**: Recompute the centroids based on the assignments.
4. **Repeat**: Continue the assignment and update steps until convergence.

## Results

### Overview

The clustering process identified X distinct clusters. Below are the summarized characteristics of each cluster:

- **Cluster 1**: Description or dominant characteristics.
- **Cluster 2**: Description or dominant characteristics.
- **Cluster 3**: Description or dominant characteristics.
